	abstract = {After its introduction to one-day cricket in 1997, the Duckworth/Lewis method has spread to become the standard rule throughout senior levels of the game for resetting the target in matches shortened after their start due to rain or other causes. This paper reviews how the method is working following its application to more than 400 known cases. A comparison of the Duckworth/Lewis model with several years of data from international matches is made that confirms the suitability of the underpinning model, but the data indicate that there is a need to update the model's parameters. An upgrading of the model is suggested to cope with high-scoring matches when the basic model's assumptions begin to break down. Although the price of the enhanced model is loss of simplicity and complete reliance on software, cricketing authorities have begun to believe the price to be worth paying. Data from actual matches are used throughout to illustrate the implementation of this successful use of Operational Research principles to the solution of a practical problem in one-day cricket.},

	abstract = {A method is described for setting revised target scores for the team batting second when a limited-overs cricket match has been forcibly shortened after it has commenced. It is designed so that neither team benefits or suffers from the shortening of the game and so is totally fair to both. It is easy to apply, requring nothing more than a single table of numbers and a pocket calculator, and is capable of dealing with any number of interruptions at any stage of either or both innings.The method is based on a simple model involving a two-factor relationship giving the number of runs which can be scored on average in the remainder of an innings as a function of the number of overs remaining and the number of wickets fallen. It is shown how the relationship enables the target score in an interrupted match to be recalculated to reflect the relative run scoring resources available to the two teams, that is overs and wickets in combination. The method was used in several international and domestic one-day competitions and tournaments in 1997.},

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

For those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  

Also, the publication Distill is just utterly beautiful: https://distill.pub/

Animations largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.
